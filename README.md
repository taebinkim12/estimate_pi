# estimate_pi

// inspired by YouTube creator, Joma Tech.
// Using a bunch of points in (x,y) where both x and y are less than or equal to 1, calculate pi...

// It sounded random in the beginning. After several hours of brainstorming, I was able to find a relatsionships between the pi and the number of dots
// that are in the circle and not in the circle.
